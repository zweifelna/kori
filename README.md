#Kori

Kori is an interface mixing tangible and voice elements to let children create stories at school.

Most of the files is from a fork of the AIY Projects (description below), and the script used for user testing is
named story1.py and is in the AIY-project/src/examples/voice repository.

The script starts directly at startup, but it is also possible to run it with python3 story1.py --language="fr-FR" (from the folder mentioned before)

# AIY Projects

This repository contains an easy-to-use Python API for the [AIY Vision Kit][aiy-vision]
and [AIY Voice Kit][aiy-voice]. The code for all AIY kits is in the `aiyprojects` branch,
and is included in images starting with `aiyprojects-2017-12-18.img`.
The previous `voicekit` branch contains code just for the Voice Kit, and the
`master` branch contains the original deprecated `Voice Recognizer` demo.
